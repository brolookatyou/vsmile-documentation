# vsmile-documentation
The repository for documenting the VTech V.Smile (and some of their other devices.)

This repository is meant for specifically documenting the V.Smile hardware.
It's a toy made by VTech to run educational games, but recently there's been alot
of interest in getting the thing to run custom software.
